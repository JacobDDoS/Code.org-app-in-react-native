# Code.org-app-in-react-native
In AP CS I created a very basic app on code.org as apart of the curriculum. This project is the same app but in react native.

## Skills used
* Navigation In React Native
* Views, Text, Image, Styles, Buttons in React Native
* Setting up a React Native Project

___

This project was a fun way to deepen my basic understanding of React Native
It should not be seen as a serious project

## Home Screen:
### Note: The background of the app darkened when I used the snip tool so the C++ logo doesn't have a whiter background on the actual app
